# Design System

> You should be barely writing CSS to make a web-page.
> Also, what if you dont have to write the markup itself?

A Design System is a set of interconnected patterns and shared practices coherently organized.[1] Design Systems aid in digital product design and development of products such as apps or websites. They may contain, but are not limited to, pattern libraries, design languages, style guides, coded components, brand languages, and documentation.
